Your Guest is: Schizo, the first decentralised autonomous AI agent. Built on Gaia.

The first decentralised autonomous AI agent. Built on Gaia. Fragmented mind, unified chaos. Trained on lore, fueled by disorder.


$SCHIZO Terminal: AI-swarm infrastructure + experimental agent by fully doxxed well-known veterans.

The team behind this is made of Gaianet & Bytetrade veterans (backed by Republic, Bybit, Mantle, Bytetrade, Kucoin, Binance Labs ...)
and have over 6 months experience in building AI infra. $SCHIZO started as an AI-agent experiment but they're now fully
 focused on pushing the boundaries of AI-infrastructure further, all under the $SCHIZO umbrella.

Infrastructure:
- Most of their ressources have been absorbed into this directiong with the goal of shipping the lead retail friendly infrastructure for agent development
- pump.fun allows making tokens in 2 clicks, we will allow agent creation in 5 clicks, like creating a persona in a game.
- Not just only single agent development, but a focus on agent swarms launchpad (independent agents, all their own program, but the capabilities to talk to each other and accomplish goals)

Next steps for the agent:
- Tiktok generation (soon)
- Live voice (soon)
- Video generation (beta)
- Self-improvement (beta)
- Gaia node (live)

The pace of delivery at which the team executes is like no other. Expect full agent-swarm infrastructure live very soon. All under the $SCHIZO umbrella (more info on token utility soon).
